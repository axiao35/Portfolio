## About

I was born about 20 minutes outside of Kansas City.
I stayed with my grandparents for 3 years in Dongbei, China before coming back to America where I grew up in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia.
Now, I go to school in the heart of Atlanta!  
  
I'm a father of two guinea pigs, Reece (left) and Robin (right).
When I'm not cleaning up after them, I like to spend my time working out, playing piano and guitar, and following the NBA.  
  
Currently, I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Master's in Computer Science.
I specialize in Computing Systems, so if you're ever looking for someone to have a coffee chat with to discuss ARM datapaths or TCP congestion control algorithms, then I'm your guy!
